# GQL Gateway 

![Build Status](https://github.com/openmfp/kubernetes-graphql-gateway/actions/workflows/pipeline.yml/badge.svg)
[![REUSE status](
https://api.reuse.software/badge/github.com/openmfp/kubernetes-graphql-gateway)](https://api.reuse.software/info/github.com/openmfp/kubernetes-graphql-gateway)

The goal of this library is to provide a reusable and generic way of exposing k8s resources from within a cluster using GraphQL.
This enables UIs that need to consume these objects to do so in a developer-friendly way, leveraging a rich ecosystem.

## Overview
GQL Gateway expects a directory as input to watch for files containing OpenAPI specifications with resources.

Each file in that directory will correspond to a KCP workspace (or API server).

For each file it will create a separate URL like `/<workspace-name>/graphql` which will be used to query the resources of that workspace.

It will be watching for changes in the directory and update the schema accordingly.

## Usage

### OpenAPI Spec

You can run the gateway using the existing generic OpenAPI spec file which is located in the `./definitions` directory.

(Optional) Or you can generate a new one from your own cluster by running the following command:
```shell
kubectl get --raw /openapi/v2 > filename
```
### Start the Service 
```shell
task start
```
OR
```shell
go run main.go start --watched-dir=./definitions
# where ./definitions is the directory containing the OpenAPI spec files
```

After service start you can access the GraphQL playground. 
All addresses correspond the content of the watched directory and can be found in the terminal output.

For example, we have two KCP workspaces: `root` and `root:alpha`, for each of them we have a separate spec file in the `./definitions` directory.

Then we will have two URLs:
- `http://localhost:3000/root/graphql`
- `http://localhost:3000/root:alpha/graphql`

Open the URL in the browser and you will see the GraphQL playground. 

### Authorization

To send the request, you can attach the `Authorization` header with the token from kubeconfig `users.user.token`:
```shell
{
  "Authorization": "5f89bc76-c5b8-4d6f-b575-9ca7a6240bca"
}
```

**If you skip that header, service will try to use a runtime client with current context.(`kubectl config current-context`)**

P.S. Skipping the header works with both API server and KCP workspace.

#### Sending queries

##### Create a Pod:

```shell
mutation {
  core {
    createPod(
      namespace: "default",
      object: {
        metadata: {
          name: "my-new-pod",
          labels: {
            app: "my-app"
          }
        }
        spec: {
          containers: [
            {
              name: "nginx-container"
              image: "nginx:latest"
              ports: [
                {
                  containerPort: 80
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
          restartPolicy: "Always"
        }
      }
    ) {
      metadata {
        name
        namespace
        labels
      }
      spec {
        containers {
          name
          image
          ports {
            containerPort
          }
        }
        restartPolicy
      }
      status {
        phase
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Get the created Pod:
```shell
query {
  core {
    Pod(name:"my-new-pod", namespace:"default") {
      metadata {
        name
      }
      spec{
        containers {
          image
          ports {
            containerPort
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

##### Delete the created Pod:
```shell
mutation {
  core {
    deletePod(
      namespace: "default",
      name: "my-new-pod"
    )
  }
}
```
### Components Overview

#### Workspace manager

Holds the logic for watching a directory, triggering schema generation, and binding it to an HTTP handler.

*P.S. We are going to have an Event Listener that will watch the KCP workspace and write the OpenAPI spec into that directory.*

#### Gateway

Is responsible for the conversion from OpenAPI spec into the GraphQL schema.

#### Resolver

Holds the logic of interaction with the cluster.

### Testing

```shell
task test
```

If you want to run single test, you need to export a KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS environment variable:
```shell
KUBEBUILDER_ASSETS=$(pwd)/bin/k8s/$DIR_WITH_ASSETS
# where $DIR_WITH_ASSETS is the directory that contains binaries for your OS.
```
P.S. You can also integrate it within your IDE run configuration.

Then you can run the test:
```


You can also check the coverage:
```shell
task coverage
```
P.S. If you want to exclude some files from the coverage report, you can add them to the `.testcoverage.yml` file.



### Linting

```shell
task lint
```

### Subscriptions

To subscribe to events, you should use the SSE (Server-Sent Events) protocol.

Since GraphQL playground doesn't support it, you should use curl.

For instance, to subscribe to a change of a displayName field in a specific account in root workspace, you can run the following command:
```shell
curl \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: 7f41d4ea-6809-4714-b345-f9281981b2dd" \
  -d '{"query": "subscription { core_openmfp_io_account(name: \"root-account\", namespace: \"default\") { spec { displayName }}}"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/root/graphql
```
Fields that will be listened are defined in the graphql query within the `{}` brackets.

P.S. Don't forget to replace the `Authorization` header with the token from the kubeconfig.

If you want to listen to all fields, you can set `subscribeToAll` to `true`:
```shell
curl \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: 7f41d4ea-6809-4714-b345-f9281981b2dd" \
  -d '{"query": "subscription { core_openmfp_io_account(name: \"root-account\", namespace: \"default\", subscribeToAll: true) { metadata { name } }}"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/root/graphql
```
P.S. Note, that only fields specified in `{}` brackets will be returned.

To subscribe to all accounts in the root workspace, you can run the following command:
```shell
curl \
  -H "Accept: text/event-stream" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: 7f41d4ea-6809-4714-b345-f9281981b2dd" \
  -d '{"query": "subscription { core_openmfp_io_accounts(namespace: \"default\") { spec { displayName }}}"}' \
  http://localhost:8080/root/graphql
```
